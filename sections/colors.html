# RGB

A computer screen is made of //pixels//. A pixel is a tiny square made of three lights: one red, one blue, and one green.

Each pixel has an //RGB// code that says what color it should be.

What do you think ''RGB'' stands for?

=====

Each light has a number from 255 (which means the light is all the way on) to 0 (all the way off).

A bright purple pixel has an //RGB// code of `255 000 255`: the pixel's **R**ed light is on, **G**reen is off, and **B**lue is on.

`170 000 170` makes a darker purple: the red and blue lights are a little dim, and green is off.

Below are some colors with their RGB codes. Fill in the blanks:

# Hex

We use the ''decimal'' system to write numbers. Computers can save memory by using the //hexadecimal// system, or ''hex''. It uses letters in place of some numbers.

<table>
|\  | code |    | code |     | code
| 0 | 00   | 10 | 0A   | 26  | 1A
| 1 | 01   | 11 | 0B   | 31  | 1F
| 2 | 02   | 12 | 0C   | 32  | 20
| 3 | 03   | 13 | 0D   | 33  | 21
| 4 | 04   | 14 | 0E   | 160 | A0
| 5 | 05   | 15 | 0F   | 161 | A1
| 6 | 06   | 16 | 10   | 175 | AF
| 7 | 07   | 17 | 11   | 176 | B0
| 8 | 08   | 18 | 12   | 240 | F0
| 9 | 09   | 25 | 19   | 255 | FF
|/
</table>

In decimal white is `255255255`, which is 9 numbers long. In hex white is `ffffff`, which is 6 numbers long. Because it takes up less space, computers often write colors in hex.

Do the last page again, this time in hex:

<table class="inline">
|\count num|  |code     |code     |code
||red         | FF      | 00      | 00
||white       | FF      | FF      | FF
||black       |_00_     |_00_     |_00_
||green       | 00      |_FF_     |_00_
||blue        |_00_     |_00_     | FF
||teal        | 00      |_FF_     |_FF_
||yellow      |_FF_     | FF      | 00
||orange      |_FF_     | AA      | 00
||grey        | AA      |_AA_     |_AA_

One nice thing about hex is that you can turn words into colors.

Fill in the blanks below. Use the word bank for the color descriptions.

<table>
|\count num||code|
||__Office__ |0ff1ce   |Blue-green
||Old dad    |_01ddad_ |Green-blue
||__Decode__ |dec0de   |__Pastel pink__
||Coffee     |_c0ffee_ |__Pale blue__
||Doodle     |_d00d1e_ |__Red__
||Fedora     |fed02a   |__Yellow__
||Bad cat    |badca7   |__Pastel green__
||__Ballet__ |ba11e7   |__Purple__
||Bieber     |_b1ebe2_ |__Blue-green__
|/
</table>

<div class="wordbank">
-=Pastel green

- Blue-green
- Yellow
- Red
- Pastel pink
- Pale blue
- Pastel green

</div>

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

If you want yellow, but `ffff00` is *too* yellow, you can give it 1 level more red with `ffff01`. You can also make it 1 level less green with `fffe00`, or 16 levels less green with `ffef00`.

Complete the equations below:

<table class="inline">
|\count num|code|code||        |  |code
||FFFF00   | +       | 1    | blue   |= |FFFF01
||232323   | +       | 1    | red    |= |242323
||EE99CC   | +       | 16   | red    |= |FE99CC
||BBAA00   | &mdash; |__1__ | green  |= |BBA900
||BBAA00   | &mdash; | 16   | green  |= |_BB9A00_
||BBAA00   | &mdash; |__17__| green  |= |BB9900
