# RGB

A computer screen is made of //pixels//. A pixel is a tiny square made of three *really* tiny lights: one red, one blue, and one green.

These are the three ''primary colors'' for computer and TV screens. You probably learned the primary colors are red, blue, and *yellow*, but screen light is different from normal light.

## How would you make these colors using only red, green, and blue?

<table>
|\count num|
||purple|=|red  |+|_blue_
||teal  |=|blue |+|_green_
||yellow|=|green|+|_red_
|/
</table>

=====

Each pixel has an //RGB// code that says what color it should make. RGB codes are made of 3 numbers.

Here are some RGB codes:

<table class="inline">
|\         |code    |code    |code
|red       |255     |000     |000
|purple    |255     |000     |255
|white     |255     |255     |255
|dark green|000     |170     |000
|/
</table>

## What do you think ''RGB'' stands for?

<fieldset>
[ ] Riemannian Gradient Base
[ ] The initials of the computer screen's inventor
[x] Red, Green, Blue
[ ] Really Good Bacon
</fieldset>

## What might the code's 3 numbers represent?

[x] The brightness of each of the pixel's 3 lights
[ ] The memory it takes to make the color
[ ] The temperature of the pixel
[ ] The letters of the alphabet in the color's name

=====

## If the first number in a pixel's RGB code is `255`, it means the pixel's red light is...

<fieldset>
[x] All the way on
[ ] A little dim
[ ] All the way off
</fieldset>

## If the second number in a pixel's RGB code is `000`, it means the pixel's green light is...

<fieldset>
[ ] All the way on
[ ] A little dim
[x] All the way off
</fieldset>

## If the last number in a pixel's RGB code is `170`, it means the pixel's blue light is...

<fieldset>
[ ] All the way on
[s] A little dim
[ ] All the way off
</fieldset>

Fill in the blanks to complete all the RGB codes:

# Hex

RGB codes are made of //decimal// numbers. To make colors, programmers often use //hexadecimal// numbers instead.

## The ''dec'' in ''decimal'' means ''ten''. The ''hex'' in ''hexadecimal'' and the ''hex'' in ''hexagon'' both mean:

<fieldset>
[x] six
[ ] circle
[ ] eight
[ ] blue
</fieldset>

## Since ''hexadecimal'' contains ''hex'' plus ''dec'', ''hexadecimal'' probably means:

<fieldset>
[ ] seven
[x] sixteen
[ ] sixty-one
[ ] blue
</fieldset>

=====

Here are some more RGB codes and their matching hex codes:

<table>
|\
|          |RGB          |Hex
|red       |`255 000 000`|`FF 00 00`
|white     |`255 255 255`|`FF FF FF`
|dark green|`000 170 000`|`00 AA 00`
|/
</table>

## Computer programmers often like to use hex codes instead of RGB codes because...

<fieldset>
[ ] Programmers are weird
[ ] Old keyboards didn't have number keys
[x] Hex codes are shorter, and so use less memory
[ ] Some languages don't have numbers
</fieldset>

Here are a bunch of decimal numbers and their matching hex numbers:

<table>
|\  | code |    | code |     | code
| 0 | 00   | 10 | 0A   | 26  | 1A
| 1 | 01   | 11 | 0B   | 31  | 1F
| 2 | 02   | 12 | 0C   | 32  | 20
| 3 | 03   | 13 | 0D   | 33  | 21
| 4 | 04   | 14 | 0E   | 160 | A0
| 5 | 05   | 15 | 0F   | 161 | A1
| 6 | 06   | 16 | 10   | 175 | AF
| 7 | 07   | 17 | 11   | 176 | B0
| 8 | 08   | 18 | 12   | 240 | F0
| 9 | 09   | 25 | 19   | 255 | FF
|/
</table>

## Which **one** of the following is **not** true?

[ ] The decimal system has 10 digits: 0 to 9
[ ] The hexadecimal system has 16 digits: 0 to F
[ ] `20` in hex is the same as `(16 x 2)`
[x] Hex numbers are easier for humans to calculate

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

If you want yellow, but `FFFF00` is *too* yellow, you can give it one level more blue with `FFFF01`.

<table class="inline">
|\code |       |  |     | |code
|FFFF00|+      |1 |blue |=|FFFF01
|FFFF00|&ndash;|1 |green|=|FFFE00
|FFFF00|&ndash;|16|green|=|FFEF00
|/
</table>

Complete the equations below:

<table>
|\count num|code||code|         |      |
||BBA900  |=|BBAA00   | &ndash; |__1__ | green
||_BB9A00_|=|BBAA00   | &ndash; | 16   | green
||BB9900  |=|BBAA00   | &ndash; |__17__| green
||_ABCEEF_|=|ABCDEF   | +       | 1    | green
||9BCDEF  |=|ABCDEF   | &ndash; |__16__|__red__
||ABCDEF  |=|_CBCDEF_ | &ndash; | 32   | red
||_B39F00_|=|B3A000   | &ndash; | 1    | green
||_299FFA_|=|299FF9   | +       | 1    | blue
|/
</table>

Color codes are //case-insensitive//: the computer treats them the same if they're UPPERCASE or lowercase.

One neat thing about knowing hex is you can make colors from words! Fill in the blanks:
