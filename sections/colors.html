A computer screen is made of //pixels//. A pixel is a tiny square made of three *really tiny* lights: one red, one green, and one blue.

Red, green, and blue are the three ''primary colors'' for computer and TV screens.

You probably learned the primary colors are red, blue, and *yellow*:

## Fill in the blanks with **red**, **blue**, and **yellow**:

|\
|red   |+|_blue_  |=|purple
|blue  |+|_yellow_|=|green
|yellow|+|_red_   |=|orange

But screen light is different from normal light.

## Fill in the blanks with **red**, **blue**, and **green**. Use the process of elimination!

|red  |+|_blue_  |=|purple
|blue |+|_green_ |=|turquoise
|green|+|_red_   |=|yellow

Each pixel has an //RGB code// that says what color it should make.

<div class="fig">`R G B`</div>

To make the color purple, a pixel needs its red and blue lights to be turned on, and its green light to be turned off:

<div class="fig">`R _ B`</div>

The RGB code for a purple pixel is:

<div class="fig">`255 0 255`</div>

???
## What does ''RGB'' stand for?

[ ] The initials of the company that makes screens
[x] Red, Green, Blue
[ ] Really Good Bacon
??/

???
## The 3 numbers in a purple pixel's RGB code show:

[x] If its red, green, and blue lights are on or off
[ ] How hot the pixel is
[ ] The letters of the alphabet in the color's name
??/

=====

A yellow pixel has an RGB code of:

<div class="fig">`255 255 0`</div>

???
## A **first** number of `255` means...

[x] The pixel's red light is all the way on
[ ] The pixel's red light is all the way off
[ ] The pixel's red light is on, but not all the way
??/

???
## A **third** number of `0` means...

[ ] The pixel's blue light is all the way on
[x] The pixel's blue light is all the way off
[ ] The pixel's blue light is on, but not all the way
??/

An orange pixel has an RGB code of:

<div class="fig">`255 170 0`</div>

???
## A **second** number of `170` means...

[ ] The pixel's green light is all the way on
[ ] The pixel's green light is all the way off
[s] The pixel's green light is on, but not all the way
