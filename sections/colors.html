You probably learned the primary colors are red, blue, and yellow:

???
## Fill in the blanks with **red**, **blue**, and **yellow**:

|\
|red   |+|_blue_  |=|purple
|blue  |+|_yellow_|=|green
|yellow|+|_red_   |=|orange

The primary colors for computer and TV screens are red, green, and blue.

A screen is made of //pixels//. A pixel is a tiny square made of 3 *really tiny* lights: one red, one green, and one blue.

???
## Fill in the blanks with **red**, **green**, and **blue**. Use the process of elimination!

|\
|red  |+|_blue_  |=|purple
|blue |+|_green_ |=|turquoise
|green|+|_red_   |=|yellow

Each pixel has an //RGB code// that says what color it should make.

<div class="fig">R G B</div>

To make the color purple, a pixel needs its red and blue lights turned on, and its green light turned off:

<div class="fig">R ... B</div>

The RGB code for a purple pixel is:

<div class="fig">255, 0, 255</div>

???
## What does ''RGB'' stand for?

[ ] The initials of the company that makes screens
[x] Red, Green, Blue
[ ] Really Good Bacon
??/

???
## The 3 numbers in a purple pixel's RGB code show:

[x] If its red, green, and blue lights are on or off
[ ] How hot the pixel is
[ ] The letters of the alphabet in the color's name
??/

=====

A yellow pixel has an RGB code of:

<div class="fig">255, 255, 0</div>

???
## The **first** number of 255 means...

[x] The pixel's red light is all the way on
[ ] The pixel's red light is all the way off
[ ] The pixel's red light is on, but not all the way
??/

???
## The **third** number of 0 means...

[ ] The pixel's blue light is all the way on
[x] The pixel's blue light is all the way off
[ ] The pixel's blue light is on, but not all the way
??/

An orange pixel has an RGB code of:

<div class="fig">255, 170, 0</div>

???
## The **second** number of 170 means...

[ ] The pixel's green light is all the way on
[ ] The pixel's green light is all the way off
[s] The pixel's green light is on, but not all the way
??/

## Fill in the blanks with 255, 170, or 0 to complete all the RGB codes:
