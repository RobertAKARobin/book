<h1>HTML</h1>

<p>Every webpage is written in HTML. The <em>M</em> stands for <dfn>markup</dfn>.</p>

<p>A school teacher <em>marks up</em> your homework. They use a red pen to mark notes on what you wrote, like <q>This part is really good,</q> or <q>This part should be longer</q>.</p>

<p>Writing HTML is also marking notes on something you write. The notes tell computers the purpose of each piece of text.</p>
