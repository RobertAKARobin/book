<h1>HTML</h1>

<p>Every webpage is written in HTML. The <em>M</em> stands for <dfn>markup</dfn>.</p>

<p>A school teacher will <em>mark up</em> your homework. They use a red pen to mark notes on what you wrote, like <q>This part is really good,</q> or <q>This part should be longer</q>.</p>

<p>Writing HTML is also marking notes on something you write. The notes tell computers the purpose of each piece of text.</p>

## What seems to be true about `< >` and `</ >`?

[ ] They group words together
[ ] They contain an abbreviation
[ ] Every `< >` has a matching `</ >`
[x] All of the above

<em><p>Two</em> things are wrong with this piece of code.</p>
<p>What are they?
``/

[x] The `<em>` starts outside the `<p>` and ends inside it
[ ] You can only have one `<p>` on a webpage
[ ] Every webpage must have a `<h1></h1>`
[x] The second `<p>` is missing a `</p>`

=====

## `<p></p>` and `<em></em>` are called...

[x] Elements: they make up every webpage on the Internet, just as elements like hydrogen and carbon make up everything in the real world.
[ ] Cookies: there are two pieces with something in the middle, and the inventors of the Internet really liked Oreos.
[ ] Bytes: `< >` looks like two mouths that are about to take a **bite** out of something.

## `<p>` and `</p>` are called //tags// because...

[x] They're little labels
[ ] They chase each other around, like in a game of Tag
[ ] ''TAG'' stands for ''Textually-Appropriate Glyph''

=====

A rule of HTML is that elements have to ''nest''. What does this mean?

[ ] Like bird nests, elements have to be woven together very carefully.
[ ] ''Nest'' is actually just a misspelling of ''west'', which is where Silicon Valley is located in the US.
[x] Each element has to be inside another element.<br/>`<A><B></A></B>` is wrong.<br/> `<A><B></B></A>` is right.
