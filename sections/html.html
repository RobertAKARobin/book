<h1>Introducing HTML</h1>

<p>Every webpage is written in HTML. The <em>M</em> stands for <dfn>markup</dfn>.</p>

<p>My teacher <em>marks up</em> my homework with a red pen: she takes my paper, circles groups of words, and writes notes next to them like, <q>Great point here</q> or <q>Fix your spelling!</q></p>

<p>Writing HTML is also grouping your words and writing clues to help the computer understand their <dfn>semantic value</dfn> -- what your words are <em>doing</em> on the page.</p>

- emphasized

<ul>
- `<p>` says, <q>This is a _paragraph_.</q>
- `<em>` says, <q>This is _emphasized_.</q>
- `<dfn>` says, <q>This is a _definition_.</q>
- `<q>` says, <q>This is a _quote_.</q>
- The ''h'' in `<h1>` says, <q>This is a _headline_.</q>

## What seems to be true about `< >`?

[ ] They group words together
[ ] They contain an abbreviation
[ ] Every `< >` has a matching `</ >`
[x] All of the above
??/

???
## `<em>``<p>`Two`</em>` things are wrong with this piece of HTML.`</p>``<p>`What are they?

[x] The `<em>` starts outside the `<p>` and ends inside it
[ ] You can only have one `<p>` on a webpage
[ ] Every webpage must have a `<h1></h1>`
[x] The second `<p>` is missing a `</p>`
??/

???
## `< >` and `</ >` are called ''<dfn>tags</dfn>'' because...

[ ] They chase each other, like in a game of Tag
[x] They're little labels that tell you what's inside, like tags on a suitcase
[ ] ''TAG'' stands for ''Textually-Appropriate Glyph''

## <b>A rule of HTML is that these <dfn>tag</dfn> groups have to ''nest''.</b> What does ''nest'' mean here?

[ ] Like bird nests, the groups have to be woven together into a circle very carefully.
[ ] ''Nest'' is actually just a misspelling of ''west'', which is where Silicon Valley is located in the US.
[x] Like Russian nesting dolls, every group has to be inside another group: `<a><B></a></B>` is wrong.<br />`<a><B></B></a>` is right.

## What name do you think goes with this definition?

<blockquote>`<p>`A group of words -- like this one -- beginning with an //open tag// and ending with a //close tag//.`</p>`</blockquote>

[ ] <q>Cookie</q>, because the two tags are like two halves of an Oreo, with something in the middle.
[ ] <q>Byte</q>, because `< >` looks like two mouths that are about to take a *bite* out of something.
[x] <q>Element</q>, because it's one building block of a webpage, just like the elements hydrogen and oxygen are building blocks of water.
