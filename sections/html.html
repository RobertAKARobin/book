<h1>Introducing HTML</h1>

<p>If you look at the code for any webpage on the Internet, the first thing you see is <dfn>HTML</dfn>. You <em>always</em> start coding a webpage by writing HTML.</p>

<p>HTML is a way of grouping words together. It lets you say to your computer, <q>Hey, <em>this</em> group of words has <em>that</em> job.</q></p>
>></

???
## What seems to be true about `< >` and `</ >`?

[ ] They contain an abbreviation
[ ] Every `< >` has a matching `</ >`
[x] Both of the above
??/

???
<ul class="wordbank">
- headline
- paragraph
- quote
- definition
- emphasized
</ul>

<ul>
- `<p>` says, <q>This is a _paragraph_.</q>
- `<em>` says, <q>This is _emphasized_.</q>
- `<dfn>` says, <q>This is a _definition_.</q>
- `<q>` says, <q>This is a _quote_.</q>
- The ''h'' in `<h1>` says, <q>This is a _headline_.</q>
</ul>
??/

???
## `< >` and `</ >` are called ''<dfn>tags</dfn>'' because...

[ ] They chase each other, like in a game of Tag
[x] They're little labels that tell you what's inside, like tags on a suitcase
[ ] ''TAG'' stands for ''Textually-Appropriate Glyph''
??/

A webpage can have as many tags as you want. They are (almost) always used to group words together.

???
## A group of words beginning with an //open tag// and ending with a //close tag//, <b>`<em>`*like this one*`</em>`,</b> is called a...

[ ] <q>Cookie</q>, because the two tags are like two halves of an Oreo, with something in the middle.
[ ] <q>Byte</q>, because `< >` looks like two mouths that are about to take a *bite* out of something.
[x] <q>Element</q>, because it's one building block of a webpage, just like the elements hydrogen and oxygen are building blocks of water.
??/

=====

HTML has simple rules:

<ol>
- Elements need an open tag and a close tag.
- Elements have to <dfn>nest</dfn>.
</ol>

???
## What do you think ''nest'' means in HTML?

[ ] Like bird nests, elements are circles that are woven together very carefully.
[ ] ''Nest'' is actually just a misspelling of ''west'', which is where Silicon Valley is located in the US.
[x] Like Russian nesting dolls or nesting boxes, every element has to be inside another element:<br />`<a><B></a></B>` is wrong. `<a><B></B></a>` is right.
??/

???
## `<em>``<p>`Two`</em>` things are wrong with this piece of HTML.`</p>``<p>`What are they?

[x] The elements don't nest: the `em` starts outside the `p` and ends inside it
[ ] You can only have one `p` element on a webpage
[ ] Every webpage must have an `h1` element
[x] The second `<p>` is missing a `</p>`
??/

=====

There are about 100 HTML elements. But you use only about 15 of them for most things.

???
## <b>Use the word bank to</b> match common elements to their definitions.<br /><b>*Include the correct punctuation!*</b>

<ul class="wordbank code">
- `<h1>`
- `<p>`
- `<blockquote>`
- `<em>`
- `<q>`
- `<ol>`
- `<strong>`
- `<ul>`
- `<h2>`
- `<li>`
</ul>

|\code
|_<h1>_         |Headline for the most important content on the page
|_<h2>_         |Headline for the second-most important content on the page
|_<p>_          |Paragraph
|_<q>_          |Quote
|_<blockquote>_ |*Long* quote
|_<em>_         |Emphasized
|_<strong>_     |*Really* emphasized
|_<ul>_         |Unordered list (bullet points)
|_<ol>_         |Ordered list (1 2 3... A B C...)
|_<li>_         |Item in a list (a *list item*)

The people who invented HTML liked abbreviations.

They could have invented a `<paragraph>` tag. Instead, they invented a `<p>` tag.

But if you don't know HTML, `<paragraph>` is much easier to understand than `<p>`.

???
## So, why did the people who invented HTML choose `<p>` instead of `<paragraph>`?

[ ] They wanted to make HTML hard to learn so no-one would copy their code.
[x] `<p>` is a lot shorter and faster to write.
[ ] No reason. It just sort-of happened.
??/

Things you write really fast can be hard to read. Things that are easy to read can take a long time to write.

Whenever you're making a coding language, you want your language to balance being easy to write and easy to read.

=====

The *M* in *HTML* stands for <dfn>markup</dfn>.

My teacher <q>marks up</q> my homework with a red pen: she takes what I wrote, circles groups of words, and writes notes next to them like, <q>Great point here</q> or <q>Fix this spelling!</q>

<p>Writing HTML is also taking what you wrote, splitting it into groups of words, and writing notes to help the computer understand each group's <dfn>semantic value</dfn> -- what the group is <em>doing</em> on the page.
