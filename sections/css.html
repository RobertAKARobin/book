## Try to fill in the blanks to complete the CSS by reading the code like English. Remember what you know about colors!

<div class="wordbank">

- `#FFFFFF;`
- `italic;`
- `center;`
- `12px;`
- `5px dotted #FFFFFF;`

A //property// is something you have. A //value// is an amount, a measurement, or a ''setting'' -- like how you can ''set'' your phone's ringtone.

???
## Look at these 2 sentences, then fill in the blanks with **property** or **value**:

<blockquote>
''This house is worth a million dollars!''
''This background color is red!''
</blockquote>

''House'' and ''background color'' are both a _property_.

''A million dollars'' and ''red'' are both a _value_.

So in the list below everything on the left is a _property_, and everything on the right is a _value_.
??/

???
## Fill in the properties and values!

<div class="ex">
|\code tdr         |code              |div|code
|background-image: |_url(stars.jpg);_ |   |url(stars.jpg);

There are over 500 CSS properties.

This means each image, button, or piece of text you see on a webpage has 500 different ''settings'' you can change to make it look different.

When you pick a property and change its value, you make a //declaration//.

???
## Look back at the CSS you have written so far and fill in the blanks:

|\                                |div|
|Every property has _:_ after it  |   |a colon, ~~`:`~~
|Every declaration ends with _;_  |   |a semicolon, ~~`;`~~
|Every RGB code begins with _#_   |   |a hash, ~~`#`~~
|''px'' stands for ''_pixels_''   |   |pixels
|/
??/

=====

Each CSS declaration needs a //selector//. It tells your computer which part of a webpage it should ''select'' to use with that declaration. For example:

```
p, code, img{
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
}
``/

This tells your computer that it should *select* something and make it 400 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.

???

## Which part do you think is the ''selector''?

[x] `p, code, img`
[ ] `width: 400px;`
[ ] `width: 400px;` **and** `height: 200px;`

??/

???

## What part of the webpage do you think this rule is *selecting*?

[x] Every paragraph, code snippet, and image
[ ] The letter 'p', the word 'code', and the letters 'img'
[ ] Any code that starts with 'p' and ends with 'img'

??/

=====

A selector and its declarations are called a CSS //rule//.

???

## Why is it called a ''rule''?

[x] Because CSS tells your computer how to behave
[ ] Because you need a **rule**r to measure things
[ ] Because CSS rules!

??/

A rule can be written on one line, or many lines. But the punctuation is always the same.

???

## Which of these do you think is most likely to make a *rule* for every abbreviation and definition on a webpage?

[x] `abbr, dfn{ font-style: italic; }`
[ ] `abbreviation and definition{ font-style: italic; }`
[ ] `abbr dfn{ font-style: italic; }`
[ ] `abbr, dfn{ font-style italic }`

??/

=====

???

## What's wrong with this CSS rule?

```
p, code
  color: #F00;
  text-align: center;

``/

[ ] A selector has to have 3 things
[x] It's missing {curly brackets}
[ ] Nothing

??/

???
## What's wrong with this CSS rule?

```
q{ background-color:#CCC color: #0F0; }

``/

[x] It's missing a semicolon ~~;~~
[ ] Each declaration must be on a separate line
[ ] That color green looks really bad on that color grey
??/

???
## What do you think `q` will select?

[x] Quotes
[ ] Just the letter `q`
[ ] The letter `p` when you look at the webpage in a mirror
??/

=====

This selects every quote and every piece of code:

<div class="fig">
`q, code`
</div>

This selects every piece of code *inside* a quote:

<div class="fig">
`q code`
</div>

???
## `p img` will select:

[ ] Every paragraph and every image
[x] Every image that's inside a paragraph
??/

???
## `p, img` will select:

[x] Every paragraph and every image
[ ] Every image that's inside a paragraph
??/

???
## Which **one** of the following do you think is true?

[x] Punctuation is really important in CSS
[ ] If you make mistakes in your code, your computer will figure it out for you
[ ] Most programmers never make mistakes
??/

=====

Fill in the selectors for...

???
## Every button that's in a form.
__form button__
??/

???
## Every button in every paragraph in every form.
__form p button__
??/

???
## Every button, every paragraph, and every form.
__form, p, button__
??/

???
## Every button and every form.
__form, button__
??/

<div class="wordbank">
-=`form button`
- `form p button`
- `form, p, button`
- `form, button`
-=/
</div>

=====

All of a website's CSS is usually kept in a file called a //stylesheet//:

```#
p, code{
  color: #000000;
  font-size: 18px;
}
p{
  color: #FF0000;
}
code{
  color: #0000FF;
}
``/

It's a *sheet* of *style* rules.

???
## The CSS above changes the `color` for paragraphs 2 times. Which `color` do you think the computer will use?

[ ] The first one, `#000000`
[x] The second one, `#FF0000`
[ ] Neither; the computer will crash
??/

???
## The font of every code snippet will be:

[x] blue and 18 pixels tall
[ ] red and 18 pixels tall
[ ] blue
??/

=====

The ''C'' in ''CSS'' stands for ''cascading''. This means three things:

-#If a website has two stylesheets, it uses both of them.
- If a website has two CSS rules for paragraphs, it uses both rules.
- ...**but** if both rules have a `color`, the website will ignore the first `color` and use the second one instead.
-#/

```#
p{
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #FFFF00;
}
code, p{
  background-color: #00FF00;
}
code{
  background-color: #000000;
  background-color: #0000FF;
}
``/

???
## Fill in the blanks with two of these words:

<div class="wordbank">
-=red
- blue
- yellow
- green
-=/
</div>

This code means paragraphs will have _green_ backgrounds, and code snippets will have _blue_ backgrounds.
