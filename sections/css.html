<blockquote>
Bob says, ''This house is worth a million dollars!'' Then Bob writes some CSS that says, ''This background color is red!''
</blockquote>

## ''house'' and ''background color'' are both called a...

[x] property: something you have
[ ] asdf

## So, everything in the left column below is a _property_, and everything in the right column is a _value_.<br />Match them up!

<table>
|\code tdr|code|count alpha divide|code|
|background-image: |_a_| |url(stars.jpg);

<!-- You change how the website looks by changing a CSS //property//. There are over 500 CSS properties. Each has a //value//. A property and its value together are a //declaration//.

Match the properties and values to make declarations:

Fill in the blanks:

<table>
|\count num||
||Every _property_ has a ~~:~~ after it.    |property
||Every _declaration_ ends with a ~~;~~.    |pixel
||''px'' stands for _pixel_.                |delcaration
||The ~~:~~ symbol is called a _colon_.     |colon

# Fonts

There are 5 //families// of fonts. Every font is in one of those families. Match each clue to its family.

<table>
|\count num||count alpha|
||<a style="font-family: 'Courier New'">All letters are one space wide</a>    ||monospace
||<a style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Dutch for ''a short line''</a>      ||serif
||<a style="font-family: Helvetica">Begins with French word for ''without''</a>    ||sans-serif
||<a style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">Looks like handwriting</a>||cursive
||<a style="font-family: Papyrus">Used mostly for logos and graphics</a>      ||fantasy
|/
</table>

=====

In CSS, you pick a font using the `font-family` property. `font-family`'s value is a list of fonts. For example:

<table>
|\count num|code
||font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
||font-family: cursive;
||font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
|/
</table>

If a font in `font-family` isn't installed on your computer, your computer tries the next one in the list. If instead of a font it's a family, like `cursive`, your computer uses any font in that family.


<div class="wordbank">
A font name that contains a _space_ must be inside "quotes".

-=space
- semicolon
- number

# Selectors

Every CSS rule starts with a //selector//. It tells the computer which parts of a website it should ''select'' to use with that CSS rule.

<div class="aside">
```
p, code, img{
  width: 400px;
}
``/
</div>

This CSS rule says, ''Every paragraph, every code snippet, and every image should be 400 pixels wide.''

<div class="aside">
```
p code img{
  width: 400px;
}
``/
</div>

This CSS rule -- without commas -- says, ''Every image that's in a code snippet that's in a paragraph should be 400 pixels wide.''

=====

-#Fill in the selector for, ''Every button that's in a form.''
>___form button___
- Every button in every paragraph in every form.
>___form p button___
- Every button, every paragraph, and every form.
>___form, p, button___
- Every button and every form.
>___form, button___
-#/

<div class="wordbank">
-=`form button`
- `form p button`
- `form, p, button`
- `form, button`
-=/
</div>

# Stylesheets

All of a website's CSS is usually kept in a file called a //stylesheet//:

```#
p, code{
  color: #000000;
  font-size: 18px;
}
p{
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
code{
  font-family: monospace;
}
``/

Each of the chunks in `{braces}` is a //rule//. The ''`p`'' rule changes all the paragraphs on the website. The ''`p, code`'' rule changes all the paragraphs *and* code snippets. Rules add on to each other.

=====

The font of every code snippet will be: __black, 18 pixels tall, and monospaced__

-#black, 18 pixels tall, and monospaced
- black, 18 pixels tall, and sans-serif
- monospaced
- sans-serif
-#/

=====

The ''C'' in ''CSS'' stands for ''cascading''. This means three things:

-#If a website has two stylesheets, it uses both of them.
- If a website has two CSS rules for paragraphs, it uses both rules.
- ...**but** if both rules have a `font-family`, the website will ignore the first `font-family` and use the second one instead.
-#/

=====

```#
p{
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #FFFF00;
}
code, p{
  background-color: #00FF00;
}
code{
  background-color: #000000;
  background-color: #0000FF;
}
``/

This code means paragraphs will have _green_ backgrounds, and code snippets will have _blue_ backgrounds.
