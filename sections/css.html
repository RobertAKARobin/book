<p style="border:5px dotted #fff; padding:0.5em 1em; text-align:center; font-style:italic; background-color:#000; color:#fff; text-shadow:none;">This paragraph has been //styled// to look different from the other paragraphs in this book. The code for styling is called //CSS//. The CSS for this paragraph is below.</p>

???
## Complete the CSS for the paragraph above.

Some hints:

<ul>
- Try reading the code like English.
- Remember what you know about RGB codes! This is a book, so the only colors are black and white.
- CSS is **very picky** about punctuation.
</ul>

<ul class="wordbank code">
- #000000;
- #FFFFFF;
- italic;
- center;
- 12px;
- 5px dotted #FFFFFF;
</ul>

```
background-color: ___#000000;___
color: ___#FFFFFF;___
font-style: ___italic;___
text-align: ___center;___
font-size: ___12px;___
border: ___5px dotted #FFFFFF;___

A //property// is something you have. A //value// is an amount, a measurement, or a ''setting'' -- like how you can ''set'' your phone's ringtone.

???
## Fill in the blanks with **property** or **value**:

<blockquote><q>This house is worth a million dollars!</q><br /><q>This background is red!</q></blockquote>

''House'' and ''background'' are both a _property_.<br />''A million dollars'' and ''red'' are both a _value_.

<div class="fig">`text-align: center;`</div>

`text-align` is a _property_, and<br />`center` is a _value_.
??/

???
## If I announce <q>*This* property has *that* value!</q> -- like <q>My favorite food is pizza!</q> -- you could say that I am <q>making a...</q>

[ ] code snippet
[ ] question
[x] declaration

??/

=====

When you pick a CSS property and give it a value, you make a //declaration//.

Looking at the declarations so far, you can see that we have used 3 punctuation marks:

|\code|
|~~:~~|*colon*
|~~;~~|*semicolon*
|~~#~~|*pound*, or *hash*
|/

???
## Fill in the blanks with the right punctuation mark:

<ul class="smblank">
- Every property has _:_ after it.
- Every declaration ends with _;_.
- Every RGB code begins with _#_.
</ul>
??/

Computers are very picky about punctuation in CSS. If the punctuation is wrong, the CSS won't work.

???
## Give each declaration the correct punctuation:

<div class="smblank">
```
background-color_:_ _#_000000_;_
color_:_ _#_FFFFFF_;_
font-style_:_ italic_;_
text-align_:_ center_;_
font-size_:_ 12px_;_
border_:_ 5px dotted _#_FFFFFF_;_
``/
</div>
??/

=====

There are over 500 CSS properties.

This means each image, button, or piece of text you see on a webpage has 500 different ''settings'' you can change to make it look different. That's a lot!

???
## How do you think most web designers memorize the CSS properties?

[ ] Lots of studying with flash cards
[ ] They are born with ''photographic'' memories.
[x] Trick question: They don't memorize them. They just use Google to look them up as they go.
??/

???
## The world's best programmers use Google...

[ ] once a month.
[x] once every few minutes.
[ ] never.
??/

???
## If a professional programmer has to use Google, it is likely that...

[ ] they will get fired right away.
[ ] all the other programmers will point and laugh.
[x] nobody will even notice, because every single programmer uses it all the time.
??/

=====

???
## Complete the CSS declarations. Include the correct punctuation.

Remember: colons ~~:~~, semicolons ~~;~~, and ''hashes'' or ''pounds'' ~~#~~.

<ul class="wordbank code">
- url(stars.jpg)
- 400px
- FF9900
- rotate(30deg)
- hidden
- bold
</ul>

```
background-image ___:url(stars.jpg);___
height ___:400px;___
border-color ___:#FF9900;___
transform ___:rotate(30deg);___
visibility ___:hidden;___
font-weight ___:bold;___

## ''px'' stands for:
[ ] pictures
[ ] pixies
[x] pixels
??/

=====

Each CSS declaration needs a //selector//. It tells your computer which part of a webpage it should ''select'' to use with that declaration. For example:

```
p, code, img{
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
}
``/

This tells your computer that it should *select* something and make it 400 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.

???

## Which part do you think is the ''selector''?

[x] `p, code, img`
[ ] `width: 400px;`
[ ] `width: 400px;` **and** `height: 200px;`

??/

???

## What part of the webpage do you think this rule is *selecting*?

[ ] The letter 'p', the word 'code', and the letters 'img'
[x] Every paragraph, code snippet, and image
[ ] Any code that starts with 'p' and ends with 'img'

(If you're not sure, think: what would be the most useful?)

??/

=====

A selector and its declarations are called a CSS //rule//.

???

## Why is it called a ''rule''?

[ ] Because you need a **rule**r to measure things
[x] Because CSS tells your computer how to behave
[ ] Because CSS rules!

??/

A rule can be written on one line, or many lines. But the punctuation is always the same.

???

## Which of these do you think is most likely to make a *rule* for every abbreviation and definition on a webpage?

[x] `abbr, dfn{ font-style: italic; }`
[ ] `abbr, dfn{ font-style italic }`
[ ] `abbr dfn{ font-style: italic; }`
[ ] `abbreviation and definition{ font-style: italic; }`

??/

=====

???

## What's wrong with this CSS rule?

```
p, code color: #F00; text-align: center;
``/

[ ] A selector has to have 3 things
[x] It's missing {curly brackets}
[ ] Nothing

??/

???
## What's wrong with this CSS rule?

```
q{ background-color:#CCC color: #0F0; }

``/

[x] It's missing a semicolon ~~;~~
[ ] Each declaration must be on a separate line
[ ] That color green looks really bad on that color grey
??/

???
## What do you think `q` will select?

[ ] Just the letter `q`
[ ] The letter `p` when you look at it in a mirror
[x] Quotes
??/

=====

This selects every quote and every piece of code:

<div class="fig">
`q, code`
</div>

This selects every piece of code *inside* a quote:

<div class="fig">
`q code`
</div>

???
## So, `p img` (with no comma) will select:

[ ] Every paragraph and every image
[x] Every image that's inside a paragraph
??/

???
## ...and `p, img` will select:

[x] Every paragraph and every image
[ ] Every image that's inside a paragraph
??/

???
## Which **one** of the following do you think is true?

[x] Punctuation is really important in CSS
[ ] If you make mistakes in your code, your computer will fix it out for you
[ ] ''Real'' programmers never make mistakes
??/

=====

<ul class="wordbank code">
- form button
- form p button
- form, p, button
- form, button
</ul>

Fill in the selectors for...

???
## Every button that's in a form.
__form button__
??/

???
## Every button in every paragraph in every form.
__form p button__
??/

???
## Every button, every paragraph, and every form.
__form, p, button__
??/

???
## Every button and every form.
__form, button__
??/

=====

All of a website's CSS is usually kept in a //stylesheet//:

```#
p, code{
  color: #000000;
  font-size: 18px;
}
p{
  color: #FF0000;
}
code{
  color: #0000FF;
}
``/

It's a *sheet* of *style* rules.

???
## The CSS above changes the `color` for paragraphs 2 times. Which `color` do you think the computer will use?

[ ] The first one, `#000000`
[x] The second one, `#FF0000`
[ ] Neither; the computer will crash
??/

???
## The font of every **code snippet** will be:

[x] blue and 18 pixels tall
[ ] red and 18 pixels tall
[ ] blue
??/

=====

The ''C'' in ''CSS'' stands for ''cascading'', like a waterfall. This means three things:

<ol>
- If a website has two stylesheets, it uses both of them.
- If a website has two CSS rules for paragraphs, it uses both rules...
- ...**but** if both rules have a `color`, the website will ignore the first `color` and use the second one.
</ol>

```#
p{
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #FFFF00;
}
code, p{
  background-color: #00FF00;
}
code{
  background-color: #000000;
  background-color: #0000FF;
}
``/

???
## Fill in the blanks with the right 2 colors:

<ul class="wordbank">
- red
- blue
- yellow
- green
</ul>

This CSS means paragraphs will have _green_ backgrounds, and code snippets will have _blue_ backgrounds.
