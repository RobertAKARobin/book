We've been using //decimal// numbers. But programmers often use //hexadecimal// numbers -- or ''hex'' -- instead.

???
## The ''dec'' in ''decimal'' means ''ten''. The ''hex'' in ''hexadecimal'' and the ''hex'' in ''hexagon'' both mean:

[x] six
[ ] circle
[ ] eight
[ ] blue
??/

???
## Since ''hexadecimal'' contains ''hex'' plus ''dec'', ''hexadecimal'' probably means:

[ ] seven
[x] sixteen
[ ] sixty-one
[ ] blue

In decimal, there are **10** digits. In hexadecimal, there are **16** digits:

|\
|Decimal:|`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`
|Hex:    |`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F`
|/

In hex, we use the letters `A` to `F` for the numbers 10 to 15. This lets us write bigger numbers in fewer spaces: `10` is two spaces long, but `A` is only one.

## Fill in the blanks to count in decimal and hex:

|\   |code|div|    |code|div|    |code
|Dec |Hex |   |_10_| A  |   | 40 | 28
|1   | 1  |   | 11 |_B_ |   |_41_| 29
|2   |_2_ |   | 12 |_C_ |   |_42_| 2A
|3   |_3_ |   | 13 |_D_ |   | 43 |_2B_
|4   |_4_ |   | 14 |_E_ |   | 44 |_2C_
|5   |_5_ |   |_15_| F  |   | 45 |_2D_
|_6_ | 6  |   |_16_| 10 |   | 46 |_2E_
|_7_ | 7  |   |_17_| 11 |   |_47_| 2F
|_8_ | 8  |   |_18_| 12 |   |_48_| 30

## Fill in the blanks to convert `3D` from hex into decimal:

The decimal system has 10 digits,<br />and 30 equals (3 &times; _10_)

In the same way, hex has _16_ digits,<br />and `30` in hex equals (3 &times; _16_)

So, `30` in hex is actually the number _48_.

`D` in hex is the number _13_. (Hint: Look at the chart at the last page.)

`3D` equals `30` &plus; `D`, or (_48_ &plus; _13_)

So, `3D` is actually the number _61_.

## Which **one** of the following is **NOT** true?

[ ] The decimal system has 10 digits: 0 to 9
[ ] The hexadecimal system has 16 digits: `0` to `F`
[ ] `30` in hex is the same as (16 x 3)
[x] It's always easier to do math in hex than in decimal

Here are some RGB codes in decimal and hex:

<div class="fig">
|\
|          |decimal    |hex
|red       |255 0 0    |`FF0000`
|white     |255 255 255|`FFFFFF`
|dark green|0 170 0    |`00AA00`
|/
</div>

Hex RGB codes are also 3 numbers, like decimal RGB codes. `FF0000` for the color red is actually `FF` for red, `00` for green, and `00` for blue.

???
## Fill in the blanks:

-=`255` in decimal is the same as `_FF_` in hex.
- `170` in decimal is the same as `_AA_` in hex.
- `0` in decimal is the same as `_00_` in hex.

## Computer programmers may like to write RGB codes in hex instead of decimal because...

[ ] Programmers are weird
[ ] Old keyboards didn't have number keys
[x] Hex RGB codes are always exactly 6 letters long
[ ] Some languages don't have numbers

## Complete all the hex codes using **`FF`**, **`AA`**, or **`00`**:

|\           |code     |code     |code
|black       |_00_     |_00_     |_00_
|green       | 00      |_FF_     |_00_
|blue        |_00_     |_00_     | FF
|teal        | 00      |_FF_     |_FF_
|yellow      |_FF_     | FF      | 00
|orange      |_FF_     | AA      | 00
|grey        | AA      |_AA_     |_AA_

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app. You don't need to do any math. Just remember:

-#When you see `ABCDEF`, you're seeing *three* numbers: `AB` for red, `CD` for green, and `EF` for blue.
- `FF` is the biggest possible number, and `00` is the smallest.

Color codes are //case-insensitive//: the computer treats them the same if they're UPPERCASE or lowercase.

One neat thing about knowing hex is you can make colors from words!

???
## How can you translate English words into RGB codes? What colors do they make?

Fill in the blanks. The missing colors are **purple**, **red**, and **yellow**.

<div class="ex">

Can you make a color from your name?
