We've been using //decimal// numbers. But programmers often use //hexadecimal// numbers -- or ''hex'' -- instead.

???
## The ''dec'' in ''decimal'' means ''ten''. The ''hex'' in ''hexadecimal'' and the ''hex'' in ''hexagon'' both mean:

[x] six
[ ] circle
[ ] eight
[ ] blue
??/

???
## Since ''hexadecimal'' contains ''hex'' plus ''dec'', ''hexadecimal'' probably means:

[ ] seven
[x] sixteen
[ ] sixty-one
[ ] blue

Here are some RGB codes in decimal and hex:

<div class="fig">
|\
|          |decimal      |hex
|red       |`255 0 0`    |`FF 00 00`
|white     |`255 255 255`|`FF FF FF`
|dark green|`0 170 0`    |`00 AA 00`
|/
</div>

???
## Fill in the blanks:

-=`255` in decimal is the same as `_FF_` in hex.
- `170` in decimal is the same as `_AA_` in hex.
- `0` in decimal is the same as `_00_` in hex.

## Computer programmers may like to write RGB codes in hex instead of decimal because...

[ ] Programmers are weird
[ ] Old keyboards didn't have number keys
[x] Hex RGB codes are always exactly 6 letters long
[ ] Some languages don't have numbers

Here are a bunch of decimal numbers and their matching hex numbers:

|\  | code |    | code |     | code
| 0 | 00   | 10 | 0A   | 26  | 1A
| 1 | 01   | 11 | 0B   | 31  | 1F

| 3 | 03   | 13 | 0D   | 33  | 21
| 4 | 04   | 14 | 0E   | 160 | A0
| 5 | 05   | 15 | 0F   | 161 | A1
| 6 | 06   | 16 | 10   | 175 | AF
| 7 | 07   | 17 | 11   | 176 | B0

## Which **one** of the following is **not** true?

[ ] The decimal system has 10 digits: 0 to 9
[ ] The hexadecimal system has 16 digits: 0 to F
[ ] `20` in hex is the same as `(16 x 2)`
[x] Hex numbers are easier for humans to calculate

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

If you want yellow, but `FFFF00` is *too* yellow, you can give it one level more blue with `FFFF01`.

???
## Complete the equations below:

|\code    | |code     |         |    |
| FFFF01  |=|  FFFF00 | +       |1   | blue
| FFFE00  |=|  FFFF00 | &ndash; |1   | green
| FFEF00  |=|  FFFF00 | &ndash; |16  | green
| ABCDEF  |=|  CBCDEF | &ndash; | 32 | _red_
| B39F00  |=|  B3A000 | &ndash; | 1  | _green_
| BBA900  |=|  BBAA00 | &ndash; |_1_ | green
| BBCDEF  |=|  ABCDEF | +       |_16_| red
| 299FFA  |=| _299FF9_| +       | 1  | blue

Color codes are //case-insensitive//: the computer treats them the same if they're UPPERCASE or lowercase.

One neat thing about knowing hex is you can make colors from words!
