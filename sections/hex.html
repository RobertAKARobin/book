We've been using //decimal// numbers. But programmers often use //hexadecimal// numbers -- or ''hex'' -- instead.

???
## <b>The ''dec'' in ''decimal'' means ''ten''.</b> The ''hex'' in ''hexadecimal'' and the ''hex'' in ''hexagon'' both mean:

[x] six
[ ] circle
[ ] eight
??/

???
## <b>Since ''hexadecimal'' contains ''hex'' plus ''dec'',</b> ''hexadecimal'' probably means:

[ ] ten
[x] sixteen
[ ] sixty-one
??/

???
## <b>The decimal system is also called ''base ten''. So</b> hex is probably also called:

[ ] base ten
[x] base sixteen
[ ] base sixty-one

In decimal, there are **ten** digits. In hexadecimal, there are **sixteen** digits:

<div class="sm">
|\
|Decimal:| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |   |   |   |   |   |
|Hex:    |`0`|`1`|`2`|`3`|`4`|`5`|`6`|`7`|`8`|`9`|`A`|`B`|`C`|`D`|`E`|`F`
|/
</div>

In hex, we use the letters `A` to `F` for the numbers 10 to 15.

This lets us write bigger numbers in fewer spaces: 10 in decimal and `A` in hex are both the same number, but ''10'' is two spaces long, and ''`A`'' is only one.

???
## Let's count up in decimal and hex:

|\   |code|div|    |code|div|    |code
|Dec |Hex |   |_10_| A  |   | 40 | 28
|1   | 1  |   | 11 |_B_ |   |_41_| 29
|2   |_2_ |   | 12 |_C_ |   |_42_| 2A
|3   |_3_ |   | 13 |_D_ |   | 43 |_2B_
|4   |_4_ |   | 14 |_E_ |   | 44 |_2C_
|5   |_5_ |   |_15_| F  |   | 45 |_2D_
|_6_ | 6  |   |_16_| 10 |   | 46 |_2E_
|_7_ | 7  |   |_17_| 11 |   |_47_| 2F
|_8_ | 8  |   |_18_| 12 |   |_48_| 30
|_9_ | 9  |   | 19 |_13_|   |_49_| 31

30 equals 3 multiplied by the number of digits in the system you are using.

The decimal system has _10_ digits,<br />so 30 in decimal = (3 &times; _10_).

The hex system has _16_ digits,<br />so `30` in hex = (3 &times; _16_) in decimal,<br />which works out to the number _48_.

`D` in hex is the number _13_ in decimal.<br />(Hint: Look at the chart on the last page.)

`3D` = `30` &plus; `D`. Converting `30` and `D` into decimal,<br />`3D` = _48_ &plus; _13_

So, `3D` equals the decimal number _61_.

## Which **one** of the following is **NOT** true?

[ ] The decimal system has 10 digits: 0 to 9
[ ] The hexadecimal system has 16 digits: `0` to `F`
[ ] `30` in hex is the same as (16 x 3)
[x] Math is totally easier in hex than in decimal

Here are some RGB codes in decimal and hex:

<div class="fig">
|\
|          |decimal    |hex
|red       |255, 0, 0    |`FF0000`
|white     |255, 255, 255|`FFFFFF`
|dark green|0, 170, 0    |`00AA00`
|/
</div>

Hex RGB codes are also 3 numbers, like decimal RGB codes. `FFAA00` for the color orange is actually `FF` for red, `AA` for green, and `00` for blue.

???
## Fill in the blanks using `**00**`, `**FF**`, and `**AA**`:

<ul>
- 255 in decimal is the same as `_FF_` in hex.
- 170 in decimal is the same as `_AA_` in hex.
- 0 in decimal is the same as `_00_` in hex.
</ul>
??/

???
## Computer programmers may like to write RGB codes in hex instead of decimal because...

[ ] Old keyboards didn't have number keys
[x] Hex RGB codes are always exactly 6 letters long
[ ] Some world languages don't have numbers

## Complete all the hex codes using **`FF`**, **`AA`**, or **`00`**:

|\           |code     |code     |code
|black       |_00_     |_00_     |_00_
|green       | 00      |_FF_     |_00_
|blue        |_00_     |_00_     | FF
|teal        | 00      |_FF_     |_FF_
|yellow      |_FF_     | FF      | 00
|orange      |_FF_     | AA      | 00
|grey        | AA      |_AA_     |_AA_

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app. You don't need to do any math. Just remember:

<ol>
- When you see `ABCDEF`, you're seeing *three* numbers: `AB` for red, `CD` for green, and `EF` for blue.
- `FF` is the biggest number, and `00` is the smallest.
</ol>

## Let's try adjusting some colors in hex:

|\code   |                        | | code
| FF00AA |+ 1 level of green      |=| FF01AA
|_FFFF00_|+ 1 level of blue       |=| FFFF01
| ABCDEF |+ 32 levels of _red_    |=| CBCDEF
| DEFFC8 |&ndash; 1 level of green|=|_DEFEC8_
|/

Color codes are //case-insensitive//: the computer treats them the same if they're UPPERCASE or lowercase.

One neat thing about knowing hex is you can make colors from words!

???
## Fill in the blanks to translate English words into RGB codes and figure out what colors they make.

The missing colors for column 3 are **purple**, **red**, and **yellow**.

<div>
|\          |code     |
|decode     |dec0de   |pastel pink
|_Office_   |0ff1ce   |blue-green
|old dad    |_01ddad_ |turquoise
|coffee     |_c0ffee_ |sea green
|doodle     |_d00d1e_ |_red_
|fedora     |fed02a   |_yellow_
|_ballet_   |ba11e7   |_purple_
|Bieber     |_b1ebe2_ |pale blue-green

</div>

Can you make a color from your name?
