There are 5 //families// of fonts:

<ul class="wordbank">
- monospace
- serif
- sans-serif
- cursive
- fantasy
</ul>

Every font is in one of those 5 families.

=====

In CSS, you pick a font using the `font-family` property:

`font-family: sans-serif;`

This tells your computer to use any ''sans-serif'' font.

If you want a *specific* sans-serif font, like Gill Sans, you use the font's name instead of the family:

`font-family: "Gill Sans";`

But what if your computer gets some CSS for a font that?

`font-family: BoodleBeedleHockALoogy;`

## A font name that contains a <b>&nbsp;</b> must be inside "quotes".

[x] space
[ ] semicolon
[ ] number
