## What is this?

A sample of a book. The complete book will be printed on paper, which is why it's <q>without a computer</q>.

## Why?

Because other ''learn-to-code'' books are:

<ul>
- Boring. I thought a more interactive one would be fun.
- Expensive. You can code a website from scratch and publish it, all for free from a library computer. Why change that?
- Long. The only people who want to read 300 pages about Javascript already know Javascript.
</ul>

## Who's this for?

People who say, <q>I'm just not a computer person.</q>
