# Colors in RGB

A computer screen is made of microscopic red, blue, and green lights. The computer sets each light's brightness with a number between 0 (or 000) and 255.

A //pixel// is a tiny square that has one of each of these lights. A bright purple pixel has an //RGB// code of `255 000 255` which means the pixel's red light is on, green is off, and blue is on.

`170 000 170` makes a darker purple: the red and blue lights are a little dim, and green is still off.

Below are some colors with their RGB codes. Fill in the blanks:

<table data-code-cols="2 3 4">
|red         |255     |000     |000
|white       |255     |255     |255
|black       |_000_   |_000_   |_000_
|green       |_000_   |255     |_000_
|blue        |_000_   |255     |255
|turquoise   |_000_   |255     |255
|yellow      |255     |255     |000
|orange      |255     |_170_   |000
|_grey_      |170     |170     |170

# Colors in Hex

We use the ''decimal'' system to write numbers. Computers can save memory by using the //hexadecimal// system, or ''hex''. It uses letters in place of some numbers: `A` for 10, `B` for 11, up to `F` for 15.

```
Dec   Hex
000...00
001...01
002...02
009...09
010...0A
011...0B
012...0C
013...0D
014...0E
015...0F
016...10
017...11
032...20

175...Af
240...F0
255...FF
```
</aside>

Take a look at the chart on the right:

In decimal white is `255255255`, which is 9 spaces long. In hex white is `ffffff`, which is only 6 spaces long. Because it takes up less space, computers often write colors in hex.

Do the last page again, this time in hexadecimal:

<table data-code-cols="2 3 4">
|red         | FF      | 00      | 00
|white       | FF      | FF      | FF
|black       |_00_     |_00_     |_00_
|green       |_00_     | FF      |_00_
|blue        |_00_     |_00_     |_FF_
|turquoise   |_00_     | FF      | FF
|yellow      | FF      | FF      | 00
|orange      | FF      |_AA_     | 00
|_grey_      | AA      | AA      | AA

# Mixing Colors

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

If you want yellow, but `ffff00` is *too* yellow, you can try `fefe00` because you know `e` is one less than `f`, or you can go the other direction with `ffff01`.

Complete the equations below:

<table data-code-cols="1 2 3 4">
|AAAA00   |+ 1 blue    |= |AAAA01
|AAAA00   |+ 1 red     |= |ABAA00
|AAAA00   |+ 16 red    |= |BAAA00
|AAAA00   |- 1 green   |= |AAA900
|AAAA00   |- 16 green  |= |AA9A00
|AAAA00   |- 17 green  |= |_AA9A00_
|ABCDEF   |+ 1 green   |= |_ABCEEF_
|ABCDEF   |_- 16 red_  |= |9BCDEF
|_CBCDEF_ |+ 32 red    |= |ABCDEF
|B3A000   |- 1 green   |= |_B39F00_

# Hex Words

One nice thing about hex is that you can turn words into colors. 

Fill in the blanks below:
