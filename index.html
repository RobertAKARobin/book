# Colors in RGB

A computer screen is made of microscopic red, blue, and green lights. The computer sets each light's brightness with a number between 0 (or 000) and 255.

A //pixel// is a tiny square that has one of each of these lights. A bright purple pixel has an //RGB// code of `255 000 255` which means the pixel's red light is on, green is off, and blue is on.

`170 000 170` makes a darker purple: the red and blue lights are a little dim, and green is still off.

Below are some colors with their RGB codes. Fill in the blanks:

<table data-code-cols="2 3 4">
|red         |255     |000     |000
|white       |255     |255     |255
|black       |_000_   |_000_   |_000_
|green       |_000_   |255     |_000_
|blue        |_000_   |255     |255
|turquoise   |_000_   |255     |255
|yellow      |255     |255     |000
|orange      |255     |_170_   |000
|_grey_      |170     |170     |170

# Colors in Hex

We use the ''decimal'' system to write numbers. Computers can save memory by using the //hexadecimal// system, or ''hex''. It uses letters in place of some numbers: `a` for 10, `b` for 11, up to `f` for 15.

<aside>
```
Dec   Hex
000...00
001...01
002...02
009...09
010...0a
011...0b
012...0c
013...0d
014...0e
015...0f
016...10

160...a0
161...a1
175...af
240...f0
255...ff
```
</aside>

Take a look at the chart on the right:

In decimal white is `255255255`, which is 9 spaces long. In hex white is `ffffff`, which is only 6 spaces long. Because it takes up less space, computers often write colors in hex.

Do the last page again, this time in hexadecimal:

<table data-code-cols="2 3 4">
|red         | ff      | 00      | 00
|white       | ff      | ff      | ff
|black       |_00_     |_00_     |_00_
|green       |_00_     | ff      |_00_
|blue        |_00_     |_00_     |_ff_
|turquoise   |_00_     | ff      | ff
|yellow      | ff      | ff      | 00
|orange      | ff      |_aa_     | 00
|_grey_      | aa      | aa      | aa

# Mixing c01025

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

If you want yellow, but `ffff00` is *too* yellow, you can try `fefe00` because you know `e` is one less than `f`, or you can go the other direction with `ffff01`. If you want a redder yellow you can try `ffee00`, then `ffdd00`, then `ffcc00` and so on.

One fun thing about this is that you can turn words into colors. Fill in the blanks below:

<table data-code-cols="2">
|Coffee     |_c0ffee_ |Pale blue
|_Office_   |0ff1ce   |Blue-green
|Old dad    |_01ddad_ |Green-blue
|_Decode_   |dec0de   |Pastel pink
|Doodle     |_d00d1e_ |Red
|Fedora     |fed02a   |_Yellow_
|Bad cat    |badca7   |_Pastel green_
|_Ballet_   |ba11e7   |_Purple_
|Bieber     |_b1ebe2_ |_Blue-green_
