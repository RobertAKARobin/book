# Colors in RGB

A computer screen is made of microscopic red, blue, and green lights. The computer sets each light's brightness with a number between 0 (or 000) and 255.

A //pixel// is a tiny square that has one of each of these lights. A bright purple pixel has an //RGB// code of `255 000 255`. This means the pixel's red light is on, green is off, and blue is on.

A dark purple pixel might be `170 000 170`. This means the red and blue lights are dim but not all the way off.

Below are several colors with their RGB codes. Fill in the blanks.

-#`red          255       000       000`
- `white        255       255       255`
- `black       _000_     _000_     _000_`
- `green       _000_      255      _000_`
- `blue        _000_     _000_     _255_`
- `turquoise   _000_      255       255`
- `yellow       255       255       000`
- `orange       255      _170_      000`
- `_grey_       170       170       170`

# Colors in Hex

We use the ''decimal'' system to write numbers. This system has 10 digits: 0 through 9.

Computers can save memory by using the //hexadecimal// system, or ''hex''. It uses letters in place of some numbers: `a` for 10, `b` for 11, and so on. It has 16 digits, 0 through `f`.

Most RGB codes are 9 digits long. White is `255 255 255`. In hex white is `ff ff ff`, which is only 6 spaces long. Because it takes up less memory, computers often write colors in hex.

Repeat the exercise from the last page in hexadecimal.

-#`red          ff       00       00`
- `white        ff       ff       ff`
- `black       _00_     _00_     _00_`
- `green       _00_      ff      _00_`
- `blue        _00_     _00_     _ff_`
- `turquoise   _00_      ff       ff`
- `yellow       ff       ff       00`
- `orange       ff      _aa_      00`
- `_grey_       aa       aa       aa`
