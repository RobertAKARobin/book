# Colors in RGB

A computer screen is made of microscopic red, blue, and green lights. The computer sets each light's brightness with a number between 0 (or 000) and 255.

A //pixel// is a tiny square that has one of each of these lights. A bright purple pixel has an //RGB// code of `255000255`, or `255 000 255`, which means the pixel's red light is on, green is off, and blue is on.

`170000170` or `170 000 170` makes a darker purple: the red and blue lights are a little dim.

Below are some colors with their RGB codes. Fill in the blanks:

-#`red          255       000       000`
- `white        255       255       255`
- `black       _000_     _000_     _000_`
- `green       _000_      255      _000_`
- `blue        _000_     _000_     _255_`
- `turquoise   _000_      255       255`
- `yellow       255       255       000`
- `orange       255      _170_      000`
- `_grey_       170       170       170`

# Colors in Hex

We use the ''decimal'' system to write numbers. Computers can save memory by using the //hexadecimal// system, or ''hex''. It uses letters in place of some numbers: `a` for 10, `b` for 11, up to `f` for 15:

```
0 1 2..10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17..32 33..160..175..240
0 1 2..a  b  c  d  e  f  10 11..20 21..a0...af...f0
```

In decimal white is `255255255`, which is 9 spaces long. In hex white is `ffffff`, which is only 6 spaces long. Because it takes up less space, computers often write colors in hex.

Do the last page again, this time in hexadecimal:

-#`red          ff       00       00`
- `white        ff       ff       ff`
- `black       _00_     _00_     _00_`
- `green       _00_      ff      _00_`
- `blue        _00_     _00_     _ff_`
- `turquoise   _00_      ff       ff`
- `yellow       ff       ff       00`
- `orange       ff      _aa_      00`
- `_grey_       aa       aa       aa`

# Mixing colors

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

For example, if you want yellow, but `ffff00` is *too* yellow, you can try `fefe00` instead, or maybe `ffff01`. If that isn't close you can try going darker with `efef00` or fainter with `ffff20`.

One fun thing about this is that you can turn words into colors. Try to match the hex codes below to their colors:

```
a b c d e f g i l o s z
            9 1 1 0 5 2
```

-#`defec8`
- `c0ffee`
- `0ff1c3`
- `bedead`
- `0lddad`
- `dadb0d`
- `b1ade5`
- `bada55`
- `be900d`
- `d0c0de`
