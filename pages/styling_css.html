# CSS

Websites are ''styled'' in a coding language called //CSS//.

You change how the website looks by changing a CSS //property//. There are over 500 CSS properties. Each has a number of possible //values//. A property and its value together are called a //declaration//.

Match the value on the right to its property on the left.
