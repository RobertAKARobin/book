# CSS

Websites are ''styled'' in a coding language called //CSS//. It looks just like the exercise on the last page.

Websites have over 500 //properties// you can change with CSS. Each property controls one little part of how the website looks. You change how the website looks by changing the property's //value//.

Match the value on the right to its property on the left.
