# Mixing Colors

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

If you want yellow, but `ffff00` is *too* yellow, you can try `fefe00` because you know `e` is one less than `f`, or you can go the other direction with `ffff01`.

Complete the equations below:

<table data-code-cols="1 2 3 4">
|FFFF00   |+ 1 blue    |= |FFFF01
|232323   |+ 1 red     |= |242323
|EE99CC   |+ 16 red    |= |FE99CC
|BBAA00   |- _1_ green |= |BBA900
|BBAA00   |- 16 green  |= |_BB9A00_
|BBAA00   |- _17_ green|= |_BB9900_
|ABCDEF   |+ 1 green   |= |_ABCEEF_
|ABCDEF   |_- 16 red_  |= |9BCDEF
|_CBCDEF_ |+ 32 red    |= |ABCDEF
|B3A000   |- 1 green   |= |_B39F00_
|299FF9   |+ 1 blue    |= |_299FFA_
