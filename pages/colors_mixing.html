# Mixing Colors

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

If you want yellow, but `ffff00` is *too* yellow, you can give it 1 level more red with `ffff01`. You can also make it 1 level less green with `fffe00`, or 16 levels less green with `ffef00`.

Complete the equations below:

<table>
|\count num|code|code||        |  |code
||FFFF00   | +   | 1    | blue   |= |FFFF01
||232323   | +   | 1    | red    |= |242323
||EE99CC   | +   | 16   | red    |= |FE99CC
||BBAA00   | -   |__1__ | green  |= |BBA900
||BBAA00   | -   | 16   | green  |= |_BB9A00_
||BBAA00   | -   |__17__| green  |= |BB9900
||ABCDEF   | +   | 1    | green  |= |_ABCEEF_
||ABCDEF   |__-__|__16__|__red__ |= |9BCDEF
||_CBCDEF_ | +   | 32   | red    |= |ABCDEF
||B3A000   | -   | 1    | green  |= |_B39F00_
||299FF9   | +   | 1    | blue   |= |_299FFA_
