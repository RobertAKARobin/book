# Colors in RGB

A computer screen is made of microscopic red, blue, and green lights. The computer sets each light's brightness with a number between 0 (or 000) and 255.

A //pixel// is a tiny square that has one of each of these lights. A bright purple pixel has an //RGB// code of `255 000 255` which means the pixel's red light is on, green is off, and blue is on.

`170 000 170` makes a darker purple: the red and blue lights are a little dim, and green is still off.

Below are some colors with their RGB codes. Fill in the blanks:
