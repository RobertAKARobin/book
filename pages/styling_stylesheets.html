# {{title}}

All of a website's CSS is usually kept in a file called a //stylesheet//:

```#
p, code{
  color: #000000;
  font-size: 18px;
}
p{
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
code{
  font-family: monospace;
}
``/

Each of the chunks in `{braces}` is a //rule//. The ''`p`'' rule changes all the paragraphs on the website. The ''`p, code`'' rule changes all the paragraphs *and* code snippets. Rules add on to each other.

>>=====

The font of every code snippet will be: __black, 18 pixels tall, and monospaced__

-#black, 18 pixels tall, and monospaced
- black, 18 pixels tall, and sans-serif
