A computer screen is made of //pixels//. A pixel is a tiny square made of three lights: one red, one blue, and one green.

Each light has a number from 255 (which means the light is all the way on) to 0 (all the way off).

A bright purple pixel has an //RGB// code of `255 000 255`: the pixel's **R**ed light is on, **G**reen is off, and **B**lue is on.

`170 000 170` makes a darker purple: the red and blue lights are a little dim, and green is off.

Below are some colors with their RGB codes. Fill in the blanks:
