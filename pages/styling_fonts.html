# Fonts

There are 5 //families// of fonts. Every font is in one of those families:

<div class="wordbank">
-=Serif
- Sans-serif
- Monospace
- Cursive
- Fantasy
-=/
</div>

<p style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS'">This paragraph uses a font that is in the _cursive_ font family. Usually we use this word to mean ''fancy handwriting'', but it really just means ''handwriting.''</p>

`Most fonts have letters that are different widths. The letters in the _monospace_ font family are all one space wide. It's great for code.`

//Serif// comes from a Dutch word meaning ''line''. //Sans// is a French word meaning ''without.'' If you keep that in mind and look closely at these letters, you can tell this paragraph is in the _serif_ family...

<p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">...and this paragraph is in the _sans-serif_ family.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Papyrus'">Web designers use serif and sans-serif fonts for almost everything because they are easy to read. They use fonts like this _fantasy_ font only for logos and graphics.</p>
