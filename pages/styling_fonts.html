# Fonts

There are 5 //families// of fonts. Every font is in one of those families. Match each clue to its family.

<table>
|\count num||count alpha|
||<a style="font-family: 'Courier New'">All letters are one space wide</a>    ||monospace
||<a style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Dutch for ''short line''</a>      ||serif
||<a style="font-family: Helvetica">Begins with French for ''without''</a>    ||sans-serif
||<a style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">Fonts that look like handwriting</a>||cursive
||<a style="font-family: Papyrus">Used mostly for logos and graphics</a>      ||fantasy
|/
</table>

In CSS, you pick a font using the `font-family` property. For example:

<table>
|\count num|code
||font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
||font-family: cursive;
||font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
|/
</table>

If the first font in `font-family` isn't installed on your computer, your computer tries the next one.

A font name that contains a _1_ must be inside `"quotes"`.

<div class="wordbank">
-#space
- semicolon
- number
-#/
</div>
