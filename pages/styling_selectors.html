# Selectors

Every CSS rule starts with a //selector//. It tells the computer which parts of a website it should ''select'' to use with that CSS rule.

<aside>
```
p, code, img{
  width: 400px;
}
``/
</aside>

This CSS rule says, ''Every paragraph, every code snippet, and every image should be 400 pixels wide.''

<aside>
```
p code img{
  width: 400px;
}
``/
</aside>

This CSS rule -- without commas -- says, ''Every image that's in a code snippet that's in a paragraph should be 400 pixels wide.''
