# Selectors

Every CSS rule starts with a //selector//. It tells the computer which parts of a website it should ''select'' to use with that CSS rule.

<aside>
```
p, code, img{
  width: 400px;
}
``/
</aside>

The selector here is `p, code, img`. It means, ''Every paragraph, code snippet, and image should follow this rule.''

<aside>
```
p code img{
  width: 400px;
}
``/
</aside>

Without commas the meaning is totally different. It means, ''Every image that's in a code snippet that's in a paragraph.''


<div class="wordbank">
  _form button_ selects every button in every form.
