# ''{{title}}''

...is what ''CSS'' stands for. ''Cascading'' means three things:

-#If a website has two stylesheets, it uses both of them.
- If a website has two CSS rules for paragraphs, it uses both rules.
- ...**but** if both rules have a `font-family`, the website will ignore the first `font-family` and use the second one instead.
