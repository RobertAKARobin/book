# ''Cascading Stylesheets''

...is what ''CSS'' stands for. ''Cascading'' means three things:

-#If a website has two stylesheets, it uses both of them.
- If a website has two CSS rules for paragraphs, it uses both rules.
- ...**but** if there are two `font-family` declarations for paragraphs, the website will use the second declaration.
