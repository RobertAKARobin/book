# Mixing Colors

Knowing how hex works makes it easier to find the perfect color for your website or app.

If you want yellow, but `ffff00` is *too* yellow, you can try `fefe00` because you know `e` is one less than `f`, or you can go the other direction with `ffff01`.

Complete the equations below:

<table data-code-cols="1 2 3 4">
|AAAA00   |+ 1 blue    |= |AAAA01
|AAAA00   |+ 1 red     |= |ABAA00
|AAAA00   |+ 16 red    |= |BAAA00
|AAAA00   |- 1 green   |= |AAA900
|AAAA00   |- 16 green  |= |AA9A00
|AAAA00   |- 17 green  |= |_AA9A00_
|ABCDEF   |+ 1 green   |= |_ABCEEF_
|ABCDEF   |_- 16 red_  |= |9BCDEF
|_CBCDEF_ |+ 32 red    |= |ABCDEF
|B3A000   |- 1 green   |= |_B39F00_
