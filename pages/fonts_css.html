# Fonts and CSS

In CSS, you pick a font using the `font-family` property. Here are some different examples:

-#`font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;`
- `font-family: cursive;`
- `font-family: Pointfree, "Courier New", monospace;`
- `font-family: Arial, sans-serif;`
-#/

-#If a computer doesn't have the first font in `font-family` installed, it uses the next font.
- Font names with spaces must be inside quotes.
