# Colors in Hex

We use the ''decimal'' system to write numbers. Computers can save memory by using the //hexadecimal// system, or ''hex''. It uses letters in place of some numbers: `A` for 10, `B` for 11, up to `F` for 15.

Take a look at the chart on the right:

In decimal white is `255255255`, which is 9 spaces long. In hex white is `ffffff`, which is only 6 spaces long. Because it takes up less space, computers often write colors in hex.

Do the last page again, this time in hexadecimal:
